# Interactive map
The interactive map lists the Accenture / Avanade centers accross the world.

# Getting started 
For now, the interactive map is just few static files. The Google maps API key in the repo is the one for production and cannot be used in local.

To run the interactive map in local, just replace the key in the index.html (line 11) and use this one : AIzaSyB41DRUbKWJHPxaFjMAwdrzWzbVKartNGg. Then, open the index in a browser.
